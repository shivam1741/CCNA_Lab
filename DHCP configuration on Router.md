# DHCP configuration on Router
## Firstly we'll understand it
### What is DHCP?
* DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
* It is a service that automatically gives IP address to devices in a network.
* Without DHCP → we must manually assign IP to every PC
* With DHCP → PC gets IP automatically in 3–5 seconds

### Why do we need DHCP?
* Imagine 200 computers in an office.
* Assigning IP manually to all → waste of time, errors, duplicates.
* DHCP solves this by automatically giving:
     * IP address
     * Subnet mask
     * Default gateway
     * DNS servers

### Using DHCP in a Network
For providing DHCP services in a network, we can either use a dedicated DHCP server or configure a router or Layer 3 switch to function as a DHCP server after enabling the required settings.
