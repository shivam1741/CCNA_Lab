# Inter-VLAN Routing using Router-on-a-Stick with DHCP
## Project Overview
* This is a well-designed project where multiple networking concepts were implemented together.
* In this lab, I used a switch, a router, and multiple end devices.
* I created three VLANs on the switch, and each VLAN contained at least two end devices.
* To assign IP addresses to all end devices in different VLANs, I configured the router to function as a DHCP server.
