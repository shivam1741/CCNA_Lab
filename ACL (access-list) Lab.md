# ACL (Access-list) Lab
## What is ACL?
* ACL (Access Control List) is a list of rules used in networking devices like routers and firewalls to control network traffic.
* These rules decide which traffic is allowed (permit) and which traffic is blocked (deny).
* It allowed and blocked traffic based on:
   * Source IP
   * Destination IP
   * Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
   * Port number (HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.)
